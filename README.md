### How the application works ?
This application searches for available employee who is free from the starting date of the new project to the end of it.
		
### What does it mean for employee to be available?
- when employee is not working on any project
- when employee will finish his/her project before the new project begins
- when an employee is having a project in a queue but the new project will start and end before the project in the queue will start
- when an employee's project in a queue ends before the new project starts
